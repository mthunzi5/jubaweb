# Juba Skills Development Academy Website - Copilot Instructions

## Project Overview
This is a professional, one-page website for Juba Skills Development Academy (Pty) Ltd, trading as KZN Project Management. The website showcases their accredited training programs, consultancy services, and project management capabilities.

## Technology Stack
- **HTML5**: Semantic structure with accessibility features
- **CSS3**: Modern styling with animations, flexbox, and grid
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: Interactive functionality and smooth animations
- **Font Awesome**: Icons for visual enhancement
- **Google Fonts**: Inter font family for professional typography

## Design System
- **Primary Color**: White (#FFFFFF)
- **Accent Color**: Gold (#D4AF37, #F4E87C)
- **Text Color**: Dark gray/black (#333333)
- **Background**: Light gray (#F8F9FA) for section alternation

## Code Standards
- Use semantic HTML5 elements
- Follow mobile-first responsive design
- Implement smooth animations with CSS transforms
- Use modern JavaScript (ES6+) features
- Maintain accessibility standards (ARIA labels, focus management)
- Keep CSS organized with clear section comments
- Use consistent naming conventions (kebab-case for CSS, camelCase for JS)

## File Structure
- `index.html`: Main HTML structure
- `styles.css`: All CSS styling and animations
- `script.js`: JavaScript functionality
- `README.md`: Project documentation

## Key Features to Maintain
1. **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with breakpoints at 768px and 480px
2. **Smooth Animations**: Scroll-triggered animations and hover effects
3. **Navigation**: Sticky header with smooth scrolling to sections
4. **Interactive Elements**: Buttons with ripple effects, animated cards
5. **Performance**: Optimized animations and debounced event handlers

## Content Sections
1. Hero/Home: Company introduction with call-to-action buttons
2. About: Company overview, mission, vision, core values
3. Training Programs: Learnerships, skills programs, short courses, corporate training
4. Services: Consultancy and project management services
5. Clients: SETA partnerships and client information
6. Accreditations: Certifications and compliance
7. Contact: Contact form, office details, social media

## Development Guidelines
- Maintain consistent indentation (2 spaces)
- Add comments for complex animations or functions
- Test responsiveness across different screen sizes
- Ensure all interactive elements have hover states
- Validate forms before submission
- Use meaningful alt text for images
- Implement loading states for async operations

## Animation Principles
- Use CSS transforms for better performance
- Keep animation durations between 0.3s-0.8s
- Implement staggered animations for card grids
- Add smooth transitions for all interactive elements
- Use ease-out timing functions for natural motion

## Browser Support
- Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Graceful degradation for older browsers
- Progressive enhancement approach

## Performance Considerations
- Lazy load images when implemented
- Debounce scroll event handlers
- Use efficient CSS selectors
- Minimize JavaScript execution on scroll
- Optimize images for web (placeholder URLs currently used)

## Accessibility Features
- Semantic HTML structure
- Keyboard navigation support
- Focus indicators for interactive elements
- ARIA labels where appropriate
- High contrast color ratios
- Alternative text for images

When making changes or additions:
1. Follow the existing code style and patterns
2. Test on multiple screen sizes
3. Ensure animations are smooth and performant
4. Maintain the professional gold and white color scheme
5. Keep the one-page scrollable layout structure
6. Test form functionality and validation
7. Verify mobile responsiveness and touch interactions
